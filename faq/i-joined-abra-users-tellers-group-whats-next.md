## Okay, I joined the Abra Users and Tellers Group. What's next?

1. First and foremost, be sure that you **have the Abra app installed** on your mobile device.

   If you are using an Android phone, [download Abra from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plutus.wallet&hl=en){:target="blank"}.

   If you are using an iPhone, [download Abra from iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/abra-global-digital-cash/id966301394?mt=8){:target="blank"}.

   Note: Abra does NOT have a desktop version, nor does it have a web version. Sorry guys :(

1. **Look for an Abra Teller!** You can buy or sell Bitcoins from an Abra Teller INSTANTLY. Good thing I am an Abra Teller, and you can [reach me (Ardee Aram) via Facebook Messenger](https://m.me/ardeearam){:target="blank"}.

1. **Have the following ready** when doing online transactions with an Abra Teller:

      * *Your Abra QR Code*

      * *Your preferred mode of payment: BDO, BPI, or GCash*

      * *The amount of Bitcoins that you want to purchase (in Peso)*
