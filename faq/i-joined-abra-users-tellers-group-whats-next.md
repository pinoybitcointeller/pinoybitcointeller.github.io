## Okay, I joined the Abra Users and Tellers Group. What's next?

1. First and foremost, be sure that you have the Abra app installed on your mobile device.

   If you are using an Android phone, [download Abra from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plutus.wallet&hl=en){:target="blank"}.

   If you are using an iPhone, [download Abra from iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/abra-global-digital-cash/id966301394?mt=8){:target="blank"}.

   Note: Abra does NOT have a desktop version, nor does it have a web version. Sorry guys :(

1. Look for an Abra Teller! You can buy or sell Bitcoins from an Abra Teller INSTANTLY. Good thing I am an Abra Teller, and you can [reach me (Ardee Aram) via Facebook Messenger](https://m.me/ardeearam){:target="blank"}.
